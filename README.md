# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and documenting what a software system (or project) needs to do. It‚Äôs one of the first and most important phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

# üîë Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1.Ensures the software solves the right problem.

2.Reduces the chances of costly mistakes later in development.

3.Serves as a blueprint for designers, developers, and testers.

# üõ†Ô∏è Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the system being developed truly meets the needs of users and stakeholders. Below are the five key activities involved:

### 1. Requirement Gathering
This is the process of collecting requirements from stakeholders, users, and other relevant sources. The main goal is to capture what the client or end-user expects from the system.  
*Example:* Conducting interviews, surveys, or reviewing existing systems.

---

### 2. Requirement Elicitation
Elicitation goes beyond gathering ‚Äî it involves actively engaging with stakeholders to uncover hidden needs, clarify vague requirements, and explore alternatives.  
*Example:* Workshops, brainstorming sessions, and use-case discussions to refine needs.

---

### 3. Requirement Documentation
All gathered and elicited requirements must be documented clearly and precisely. The most common form is the **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document.  
*Example:* Writing down functional requirements (‚ÄúThe system must send confirmation emails‚Äù) and non-functional requirements (‚ÄúThe system must respond within 2 seconds‚Äù).

---

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
At this stage, requirements are analyzed for feasibility, completeness, and consistency. Modeling techniques such as use-case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFD), or UML diagrams may be used to visualize how the system will function.  
*Example:* Using UML to model the relationship between users and booking functionality in a travel system.

### 5. Requirement Validation
Validation ensures that the documented requirements truly reflect the needs of stakeholders. This step involves reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping to confirm accuracy before moving into design and development.  
*Example:* Sharing the SRS with stakeholders to confirm that nothing is missing or misunderstood.

# Types of Requirements
When developing a system, requirements are classified into **Functional** and **Non-functional**.  
Functional requirements focus on *what the system should do*, while Non-functional requirements focus on *how the system should perform*.

---

### Functional Requirements
**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe the specific tasks, services, and functions that the system must be able to perform. They are the **core features** that directly fulfill user needs.  

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**  
- The system must allow customers to create, view, update, and cancel bookings.  
- The system must send confirmation notifications via email or SMS after a booking.  
- The system must let administrators manage available rooms and schedules.  
- The system must generate booking and payment reports for managers.  
- The system must allow users to search for available rooms by date, category, and price.  

---

### Non-functional Requirements
**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements define the **quality attributes** and constraints of the system. They do not describe features, but rather how well the system performs its functions.  

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**  
- The system should process booking requests within **2 seconds**.  
- The system must be available **24/7** with at least **99.9% uptime**.  
- The user interface must be mobile-responsive and accessible to people with disabilities.  
- All sensitive user data must be encrypted and comply with **GDPR** regulations.  
- The system must handle at least **1,000 concurrent users** without crashing.

## Use Case Diagrams

**Definition:**  
A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation that shows the interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and the **system** itself. It captures the **functional requirements** of the system in a simple and easy-to-understand way.  

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**  
- Provides a clear overview of system functionality.  
- Helps identify the roles of different actors and their interactions.  
- Bridges the communication gap between stakeholders and developers.  
- Supports requirement validation and ensures alignment with business goals.

### Use Case Diagram for Booking Management System  

Below is the use case diagram representing the **Booking Management System**.  

**Actors:**  
- **Customer**: Makes bookings, cancels bookings, views booking details, receives notifications.  
- **Admin**: Manages room availability, approves/rejects bookings, generates reports.  
- **Payment Gateway**: Processes payments for bookings.  

**Use Cases:**  
- Create Booking  
- Cancel Booking  
- View Booking Details  
- Receive Confirmation  
- Manage Rooms  
- Approve/Reject Booking  
- Generate Reports  
- Process Payment
