# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and documenting what a software system (or project) needs to do. It‚Äôs one of the first and most important phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

# üîë Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1.Ensures the software solves the right problem.

2.Reduces the chances of costly mistakes later in development.

3.Serves as a blueprint for designers, developers, and testers.

# üõ†Ô∏è Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the system being developed truly meets the needs of users and stakeholders. Below are the five key activities involved:

### 1. Requirement Gathering
This is the process of collecting requirements from stakeholders, users, and other relevant sources. The main goal is to capture what the client or end-user expects from the system.  
*Example:* Conducting interviews, surveys, or reviewing existing systems.

---

### 2. Requirement Elicitation
Elicitation goes beyond gathering ‚Äî it involves actively engaging with stakeholders to uncover hidden needs, clarify vague requirements, and explore alternatives.  
*Example:* Workshops, brainstorming sessions, and use-case discussions to refine needs.

---

### 3. Requirement Documentation
All gathered and elicited requirements must be documented clearly and precisely. The most common form is the **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document.  
*Example:* Writing down functional requirements (‚ÄúThe system must send confirmation emails‚Äù) and non-functional requirements (‚ÄúThe system must respond within 2 seconds‚Äù).

---

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
At this stage, requirements are analyzed for feasibility, completeness, and consistency. Modeling techniques such as use-case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFD), or UML diagrams may be used to visualize how the system will function.  
*Example:* Using UML to model the relationship between users and booking functionality in a travel system.

---

### 5. Requirement Validation
Validation ensures that the documented requirements truly reflect the needs of stakeholders. This step involves reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping to confirm accuracy before moving into design and development.  
*Example:* Sharing the SRS with stakeholders to confirm that nothing is missing or misunderstood.
