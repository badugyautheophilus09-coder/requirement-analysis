# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

# What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and documenting what a software system (or project) needs to do. It’s one of the first and most important phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

# 🔑 Why It’s Important
1.Ensures the software solves the right problem.

2.Reduces the chances of costly mistakes later in development.

3.Serves as a blueprint for designers, developers, and testers.

# 🛠️ Steps in Requirement Analysis
1.Gathering Requirements – talk to stakeholders, clients, and end-users to understand their needs.
Example: The client says they want a booking system for flights.

2.Analyzing Requirements – check if the requirements are clear, complete, and possible.
Example: Do they want real-time seat availability? Is payment integration needed?

3.Documenting Requirements – create clear documentation like a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
Example: “The system must allow users to search for flights by date, destination, and price.”

4.Validating Requirements – confirm with stakeholders that the documented requirements match what they need.
